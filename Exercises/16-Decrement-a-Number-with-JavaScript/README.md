# Decrement a Number with JavaScriptPassed
You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the `--` operator.
```js
i--;
```
is the equivalent of
```js
i = i - 1;
```
Note: The entire line becomes `i--;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Change the code to use the `--` operator on `myVar`.
